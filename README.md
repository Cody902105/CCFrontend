# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

Greetings, this is the Frontend counterpart to CCBackend, inventive names I know. 

Please feel free to add an issue if you want additional features. The todo list here is the same as Backend so have a look at the backend stuff if you want to see what I'm working on. 

You will probably need to change the BASE_URL variable to the address of your Backend server. Otherwise you're welcome to use this as a frontend for your backend system, I'll put up some documentation for the API so you can see what the backend spits out and therefore what the front-end takes.

Hopefully some folk find this usefull.
